CHANGE LOG.

======================================

======================================

ofxFlashInteractiveObject - mouse events listeners are removed when object is destroyed - missed this before.
ofxFlashInteractiveObject - added mouseUpOutside(). object goes back to up state if mouse goes outside of bounds when pressed - this is default behaviour in flash.
ofxFlashDisplayObject - globalToLocal(), globalToLocal3D(), hitTestPoint(), local3DToGlobal(), localToGlobal() - are now working.
ofxFlashStage - added stageMouseX and stageMouseY - so all display objects can get the global mouseX and mouseY from the stage.
ofxFlash_example_02 updated. Box includes mouseDown() visual change.


======================================
05.12.2010

ofxFlashDisplayObject - added level property.
ofxFlashDisplayObjectContainer - sets level property in addChild() and removeChild() methods.
ofxFlashInteractiveObject - added mouseOverDirty and mouseDownDirty, which are temp values for when working out mouseOver and mouseDown.

======================================

Added alpha channel support to ofxFlashShape.
Added alpha channel support to ofxFlashDisplayObject
Added compound alpha, which is the multiple of alpha down the parent/child chain.
Alpha blending is now enabled before all flash assets are drawn to screen and turned off when finished - previously it was done per asset.
Removed dependencies on POCO events so its now optional.
ofxFlash now working on the iPhone / iPad.
- had to introduce touch mode as mouse and touch events behave differently. touch mode needs to be set to true on ios devices.
- added ofxFlashLibraryLoader & ofxFlashLibraryLoaderIOS to ofxFlash. these two classes load assets like images and videos.
